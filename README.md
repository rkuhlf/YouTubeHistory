# YouTubeHistory

Youtube History is a little tool I made to allow you to more easily see and understand the growth of a youtuber. It allows you to compare data from multiple youtubers over a specified number of videos.

## Built With

* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/) - The graphing system used
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used to simplify javascript queries
* [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/) - Used to get the data on videos

## Authors

* **Riley Kuhlman** - *Initial work* - [rkuhlf](https://github.com/rkuhlf/)

## Acknowledgments

* I used [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)'s [tutorial]() to help me get started with the Youtube api 
* I was inspired to make this so I could get some experience using the youtube api and graphing with javascript
